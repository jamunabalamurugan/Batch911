1. Create a class called Accounts which has data members like ACCOUNT no, Customer name, Account type, Transaction type (d/w), amount, balance
D->Deposit
W->Withdrawal
-If transaction type is deposit call the credit(int amount) function and update balance
-If transaction type is withdraw call debit(int amt)function and update balance
-Pass the other information like Acount no,name,acc type through constructor
-call the show data method to display the values.

2. Create a class called student which has data members like rollno, name, class, SEM, branch,int [] marks=new int marks [5](marks of 5 subjects )
-Write a method called displayresult, which should calculate the average marks
-If marks of any one subject is less than 35 print result as failed
-If marks of all subject is >35 but average is < 50 then also print result as failed
-If avg > 50 then print result as passed.
-Pass the details of student like rollno, name, class, SEM, branch in constructor
-Write a Display Data method to display all values.

3. Create an Abstract class Student with  Name, StudentId, Grade as members and also an abstract method Boolean Ispassed(grade) which takes grade as an input and checks whether student passed the course or not.  

Create 2 Sub classes Undergraduate and Graduate that inherits all members of the student and overrides Ispassed() method 

For the UnderGrad class, if the grade is above 70.0, then isPassed returns true, otherwise it returns false. For the Grad class, if the grade is above 80.0, then isPassed returns true, otherwise returns false.

4. Create an Employee class with Empid int, Empname string, Salary float. Pass values to the members through Constructor.

Create a derived class called ParttimeEmployee with Wages as a data member. Instantiate the base class through the derived class constructor
